# Google software JSON schemas

## Santa

### In-Progress / Not Tested

##### [com.google.santa.json](https://github.com/scriptsandthings/scriptsandthings_Jamf_JSON_Schemas/blob/main/Schemas/Google/com.google.santa.json)

Messing around with Santa as an alternative for USB volume blocking. I don't have a sync server or way to quickly stand one up.

Trying to expand on previous JSON schemas for Santa and adding current (and previously used?) keys.

# Apple JSON Schemas
## CIS 2022 Security Benchmarks - Level 1 and Level 2
### For macOS Monterey

These JSON schemas were originally created with the goal of simplifying the enforcement of CIS benchmarks level 1 and level 2 for macOS Monterey and Big Sur.

These JSON schemas may cover additional settings that are not required by CIS benchmarks that are managed by the same preference domain for simplification during deployment.

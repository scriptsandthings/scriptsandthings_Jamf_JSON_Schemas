# Apple JSON Schemas
## CIS Security Benchmarks 
### Level 1 and Level 2

These JSON schemas were originally created with the goal of simplifying the enforcement of CIS benchmarks level 1 and level 2.

These JSON schemas may cover additional settings that are not required by CIS benchmarks that are managed by the same preference domain for simplification during deployment.

# Apple JSON Schemas
## CIS 2022 Security Benchmarks - Level 1 and Level 2
### For macOS Monterey

These JSON schemas were originally created with the goal of simplifying the enforcement of CIS benchmarks level 1 and level 2 for macOS Monterey and Big Sur.

These JSON schemas may cover additional settings that are not required by CIS benchmarks that are managed by the same preference domain for simplification during deployment.


#### Note: Most of the .plists spit out by the [CIS-macOS-Security project](https://github.com/mvdbent/CIS-macOS-Security) level 1 and level 2 have been converted to JSON schemas and added to this repo (with some additional keys added). I'll continue working on adding the last few missing JSON schemas in the next few days, and continue updating these JSON schemas to add additional keys covered by the [Apple Device Managment documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicemanagement) over the next few weeks to make them a bit more comprehensive in what they cover beyond just applying suggested CIS benchmarks to macOS Monterey (and macOS Big Sur in some cases).
